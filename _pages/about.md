My name is Philippa (Pip) Doherty. I have been practicing ceramics for over 13 years! By day I am a programmer (see this very nice website?)

My ceramics path ...

I've been practicing ceramics since 2010, I got classes as a gift from my parents. I started out learning as much as I could from my teacher and friend George Peck of G. Peck Pottery in upstate NY. I eventually rented studio space from him in his beautiful studio which had a massive window looking out over his property.. I am currently a member of the Buffalo Clay Art Center in Buffalo, NY, where I have been for the last five years.
